# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Classification
The aim of this project is to predict whether the cancer tumor is malignant or benign with using machine learning models.
I used 3 different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ANN) to predict the result. This project's credit goes to HERMES AI Excellence Center in Barcelona for motivating me to finaly transform this idea into programs and build a tangible outcome related to AI usage in Healthcare. 

# Introduction
Breast cancer, the second most common cancer across the world after lung cancer, is by far the most frequent cause of cancer death in women [1]. The best approach to lessen breast tumor passing is recognize it prior. Early finding requires an exact and solid determination method that enables doctors to recognize breast tumours from dangerous ones without going for surgical biopsy [2]. This project is undertaken to recognize malignant and benign tumors from the given characteristics of breast mass computed from dataset. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer [3]. 

# Project Overview
In order to achieve the goal, following steps are done: 
- Exploratory data analysis 
- Preprocess data with feature scaling 
- Implement Logistic Regression, Random Forest and ANN models
- Compare the models with evaluation metrics
- Conclusion & Future Work

## About Dataset
Data can be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The image is a radiograph of the frontal lobe of the breast.
